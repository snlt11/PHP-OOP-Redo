#I am relearning Object-Oriented Programming in PHP. 
#You can watch and understand it as I do. 
#I am sharing this note to help you understand the concepts.

Access Modifier

public
// can access this variable from outside the class

private
// can not access this variable from outside the class (Encapsulation)

protected
// can only access this variable from inside the class and its child class

$this-> pointer to the object making function call

**Inheritance**
When we have the same properties in different classes, we don't want to rewrite them. 
Instead, we use inheritance(extends).
For example, suppose a Member has properties like name, age, and address, as well as methods. 
A DiamondMember also has the same properties. 
In this case, we set Member as the parent class and DiamondMember as the child class.
Class can override the properties and methods of the parent class.

Parent Constructor Invoking
    parent::__construct();

**Traits**
In PHP, a class can extend only one other class due to single inheritance.
However, if you want to use functionality from multiple classes, you can use traits.
We have three types of members and a Special Member. 
Special Members can access all the functionality of the three member types. 
Since a class can only extend one class, we cannot have all three member types extend the Special Member class. 
This is where we use traits.

Magic Methods

Used when we are trying to access non-existing properties.

__set

__isset
Used when we are trying to check if a non-existing property is set.

__unset
Used when we are trying to unset a non-existing property.

__call
Used when we are trying to call a non-existing method.

__callStatic
Used when we are trying to call a non-existing static method.
