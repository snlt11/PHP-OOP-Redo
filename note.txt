#I am relearning Object-Oriented Programming in PHP. 
#You can watch and understand it as I do. 
#I am sharing this note to help you understand the concepts.

Access Modifier

public
// can access this variable from outside the class

private
// can not access this variable from outside the class (Encapsulation)

protected
// can only access this variable from inside the class and its child class

$this-> pointer to the object making function call

**Inheritance**
When we have the same properties in different classes, we don't want to rewrite them. 
Instead, we use inheritance(extends).
For example, suppose a Member has properties like name, age, and address, as well as methods. 
A DiamondMember also has the same properties. 
In this case, we set Member as the parent class and DiamondMember as the child class.
Class can override the properties and methods of the parent class.

**Traits**
In PHP, a class can extend only one other class due to single inheritance.
However, if you want to use functionality from multiple classes, you can use traits.
We have three types of members and a Special Member. 
Special Members can access all the functionality of the three member types. 
Since a class can only extend one class, we cannot have all three member types extend the Special Member class. 
This is where we use traits.

**Interface**
We have an application that needs to handle different payment methods like credit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers. 
Each payment method requires the same actions: depositMoney(), withdrawMoney(), transferMoney() and refundPayment().
To ensure all payment methods are managed consistently, 
we define an 'interface' that enforces these actions for all payment method classes.
// Create an 'interface' and use it with the 'implements' keyword. 
When we use implements, we need to rewrite all the methods in the class.
We cannot create variables (properties) in an interface but can create Concrete(constants (`const`)).

Difference between Interface & Abstract

**Abstract Methods**
The 'Methods' and the 'Class' must be declared as abstract.
Abstract methods do not have a body.
If a subclass 'extends' an abstract class, it must override and provide implementations for all abstract methods.
A class can only 'extends' one 'Abstract' class

// Payment processing system that supports different types of payments like 
    credit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers. Each payment type has its own way of processing payments, 
    but they share some common functionality.

**Static and Non-Static Methods**
Static Methods: Cannot call non-static 'method' & 'variables' directly.
Non-Static Methods: Can call static methods.

**Data Binding**
// Compile  ==  Early Binding   ==  Dynamic Binding
index.php => Compile => Execution => Early Binding
Compilation is the process of converting code written in a high-level programming language into machine code 
that a computer's processor can execute directly.

//Transpile   ==  Late Binding    ==  Late Static Binding
index.php => Transpile => Execution => Late Binding
Transpilation is the process of converting code from one high-level programming language 
to another high-level programming language.

$this 
// self:: refers to the class in which it is used at the time of definition, not at runtime.
// static:: refers to the class in which it is called, even if it's inherited and called in a subclass.

Magic Methods

Parent Constructor Invoking
    parent::__construct();

__get:
Used when we are trying to access non-existing properties.

__set:
Used when we are trying to set non-existing properties.

__isset:
Used when we are trying to check if a non-existing property is set.

__unset:
Used when we are trying to unset a non-existing property.

__call:
Used when we are trying to call a non-existing method.

__callStatic:
Used when we are trying to call a non-existing static method.

Serialization:
Serialize the object or array using serialize(), which converts it into a string. 
This string can then be stored in a database, cached, or transmitted.

__sleep:
This method is used when we are trying to serialize an object. 

Unserialization:
Unserialize the string back into an object or array using unserialize(), 

__wakeup:
This method is used when we are trying to unserialize an object. 

__toString:
This method is used when we want to automatically convert a 'Class' object into a string, 
typically for cases where we use 'echo' or 'print' with an instance of the class.

__invoke:
This method is used when we want to treat a class object as a function.

__clone:
This method is used when we clone an object of a class to create another instance.
The __clone magic method is invoked automatically during the cloning process.

Checking Variable Types

is_int()
is_bool()
is_string()
is_null()
is_float()

Function
Anonymous function
Lambda function
Closure function can access global variable by using use($value)

variadic (...)
coalesce (??)

Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message.
Use interfaces or abstract classes to implement polymorphism in PHP.
